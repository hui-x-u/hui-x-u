## Software Developer & Data Analyst
***
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently pursuing an **Applied Data Science M.Eng.** at the University of Victoria, where I focus on machine learning and data analysis. 

I also hold a **Computer Science M.Sc.** from the University of Southern California, with a specialization in software development. 

Previously, I worked as a software developer at China Merchants Bank in Suzhou from December 2021 to May 2023, where I delivered high-quality applications for marketing and business optimization tools and developed internal management software (ERP systems) to enhance the company's operational efficiency.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect! ðŸ˜Š
